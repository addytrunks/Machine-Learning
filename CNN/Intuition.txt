Plan of Attack:
	Step 1: Convolution Neural Networks
		Step 1(b): ReLU Layer
	Step 2: Pooling
	Step 3: Flattening
	Step 4: Full Connection
Softmax and Cross-Entropy

WHAT ARE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS?

You pass an image to a CNN, it gives the output (image label class)
Eg:
	Smiley Face (Image) ---> CNN (Processing) ---> Happy (Output)
